# Awesome API

This is an API that serves `ticks`. This project consists of two main pieces:

- API - A Ruby/Sinatra application with connections to Postgres and Redis
- Worker - A [`Sidekiq`](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) powered background worker that reads and writes a Redis instance

## Prerequisites

- You should have the Ruby version listed in `Gemfile` installed.
- You should have the latest version of `Postgres 9.x` installed.
- Redis is required. To install and start:

- `$ brew install redis`
- `$ redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf` (needs to be running for tests to pass)

- You will also require the `foreman` and `bundler` gems:

  ```
  $ gem install bundler
  $ gem install foreman
  ```

## Set-up

Install dependencies:

```
$ foreman run bundle install
```

Create a `test` and a `development` database:

```
$ psql

psql$  CREATE DATABASE my_api_development;
psql$  CREATE DATABASE my_api_test;
```

Copy `.env_example` to `.env` and fill out all values - ensure you include the
URLs for the development and test databases you just created.

Now run database migrations:

```
$ foreman run bundle exec db:migrate
$ foreman run bundle exec db:migrate RACK_ENV=test
```

## Start the server

To start the server:

```
$ foreman start
```

This command starts the api server and the background worker application.

# API

- `GET /ticks`: Show number of ticks been processed by the server
- `POST /ticks`: Adds a new `tick` to thaequeue to be processed asynchronously. It will take 10 seconds for a `tick` to be processed


# Deployment

The 2 components that form this application should be deployed together. This repository SHOULD NOT be deployed if the tests are failing.
